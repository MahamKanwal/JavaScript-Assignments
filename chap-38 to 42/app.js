//----------CHAPTER 38-42
// ------TASK 1
//1. Write a custom function power ( a, b ), to calculate the value of
// a raised to b.

function power(a,b){
    var result = a**b;
    console.log(result);
}
power(3,4);

// Task 2
//Any year is entered through the keyboard. Write a function to determine whether the year is a leap year or not.

// function power(a,b){
//     console.log(a**b);
// }
// power(5,9)

// var year = +prompt("enter a year");
// switch(year){
//     case "2012" :
//         console.log("leap year");
//         break;

//         case "2016" :

//         console.log("leap year");
//         break;

//         default :
//         console.log("this not a year");
// }

// Task 3
//If the lengths of the sides of a triangle are denoted by a, b, and c, then area of triangle is given by area = S(S − a)(S − b)(S − c) where, S = ( a + b + c ) / 2

// var a = +prompt("enter your first side");
// var b = +prompt("enter your second side");
// var c = +prompt("enter your third side");

// function findingS(a,b,c){
//   var S = (a+b+c)/2
//   return S;
// }
// var foundS = findingS(a,b,c)

//  console.log(foundS)
//  findingS(a,b,c)

// function area(foundS){
//     var findingArea = findingS*(foundS-a)*(foundS-b)*(foundS-c)
//   return findingArea
// }

// var result = area(foundS)
// console.log(result)

// Task 4

// 4. Write a function that receives marks received by a student in 3
// subjects and returns the average and percentage of these
// marks. there should be 3 functions one is the mainFunction
// and other are for average and percentage. Call those functions




// Task 5
//You have learned the function indexOf. Code your own custom function that will perform the same functionality. You can code for single character as of now.







// Task 6
// Write a function to delete all vowels from a sentence. Assume that the sentence is not more than 25 characters long.



// Task 7
// Write a function with switch statement to count the number of occurrences of any two vowels in succession in a line of text.





// Task 8

// Task 9
// Write a program to calculate overtime pay of employees.Overtime is paid at the rate of Rs. 12.00 per hour for every hour worked above 40 hours. Assume that employees do not work for fractional part of an hour.



// Task 10
